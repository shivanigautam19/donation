                <p>The world is facing an unprecedented challenge with communities and economies everywhere affected by
                    the
                    growing COVID-19 pandemic. The world is coming together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic bringing
                    governments, organizations from across industries and sectors and individuals together to help
                    respond
                    to this global outbreak. The outpouring of global solidarity and support sparked by this shared
                    challenge has been phenomenal.</p><br>

                <p>The work in 2021 builds on the progress achieved in 2020, continues to support the response in
                    countries
                    towards suppressing transmission, reducing exposure, countering misinformation and disinformation,
                    protecting the vulnerable, reducing mortality and morbidity rates and increasing equitable access of
                    diagnostics and vaccines for all.</p><br>
                <p>Change the Vision Foundation is a nonprofit that supports other nonprofits by connecting them to
                    donors and
                    companies.
                    Since 2019, we've helped trusted, community-led organizations from Singapore to India (and
                    hundreds
                    of places in between) access the tools, training, and support they need to make our world a better
                    place.
